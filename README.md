Telegram bot for translation
The Telegram Translation Bot is a versatile bot that helps you translate messages from one Telegram channel to another in a desired language. It enables you to create multiple channel pairs, where the bot listens for messages from a specific user in the source channel and translates them into the target language, sending them to the corresponding destination channel.
